### incursionRefresh
Graphile-worker job module named `incursion-refresh`, scheduled every 5 minutes (matching ESI's `/incursions/` cache).

Fetches `getIncursions` through `esiCall`, full-replaces `universe_incursion` in a transaction (active incursions are few and short-lived; withdrawing ones just drop out of the payload), then warms the name cache for the incursion faction ids via `resolveStaleEntityNames`. Returns `{ fetched, infestedSystems }` notes for `ap_job_run`.
