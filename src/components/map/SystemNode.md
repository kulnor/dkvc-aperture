## SystemNode

**Purpose:** xyflow custom node rendering a single map system tile (status stripe, security badge, tag, alias/name, lock, statics/effect line) with inline edit affordances for alias and tag.
**File:** `src/components/map/SystemNode.tsx`

### Props
Receives xyflow `NodeProps` with `data: SystemNodeData` and `selected`.

`SystemNodeData` extends `MapSystemNode` with an optional `onAliasOrTagCommit(mapSystemId, field, next)` callback wired by `MapCanvas`. When the callback is present, the alias and tag chips render via `InlineTextEdit` (double-click to edit, Enter commits, Esc cancels, blur cancels, empty commits as null). When absent the chips fall back to plain spans (legacy read-only path).

### Renders
A card with a left status stripe (colour from `systemStatusColor`), a head row (security label, tag chip, alias-or-name, optional pilot-presence badge, lock icon), and — for wormhole systems or systems with an effect — a secondary line listing the effect and static target-class labels (e.g. "C3 C5"). Each static label is coloured via `systemClassColor`. Region/constellation shown as the hover title.

### Behaviour & Interactions
- Drag handles on all four sides (top / right / bottom / left) are visible at low opacity to invite connections; xyflow `nodesConnectable` / `nodesDraggable` are controlled by `MapCanvas`. All four are declared as `type="source"` and the canvas runs in `ConnectionMode.Loose` so any side can act as either end of a new connection. `ConnectionEdge` picks which two sides to render against at draw time based on relative node centres, so the stored handle pair is incidental.
- Selection is reflected by a prominent halo in the system's status colour — an offset solid outline (2px, 3px offset) plus a soft outer glow (`box-shadow` with alpha'd status hex) and a slight `scale(1.04)` lift, transitioned over 150ms. This reads at a glance regardless of how muted the status stripe is. Selection state is owned by `MapCanvas`. The card uses `cursor-pointer` so the entire tile reads as clickable — any click bubbles through xyflow's node wrapper to fire selection.
- Wormhole detection: has statics, or name matches `J######`.
- Inline editors carry `nodrag nopan` (set inside `InlineTextEdit`) so editing doesn't trigger pan / drag.
- **Pilot-presence badge** (`PresenceBadge`, internal): reads `usePresenceForSystem(data.systemId)` (see `MapPresenceContext`). Renders nothing when the count is zero. Otherwise renders a small rounded-pill button (Users icon + count) wrapped in Base UI `PreviewCard`. Hover or focus opens a popup listing every online tracked pilot in the system as `name — shipName` with the ship *type* name on a secondary muted line beneath. The type line is omitted when the pilot never renamed the hull (ESI defaults `ship_name` to the type name, so `shipName === shipTypeName`); falls back to `shipTypeName` then `—` when no custom name is known. The trigger and popup both carry `nodrag nopan` so the hover interaction never starts a canvas pan/drag.
- All other field edits (status, intel notes, locked, rally, signatures, remove) live in `InspectorModule`.
- **Underglow** (Stage 17.8): the tile is `relative`; when `useUnderglowForSystem(data.id)` returns an active glow, a `SystemUnderglow` is rendered behind the card (keyed by the store's `token` so a rapid re-trigger restarts the animation). Today only killmail alerts trigger it (red pulse, via `MapUnderglowBridge`); the primitive is config-driven for future rally/unscanned-sig use.

### Depends On
- `@xyflow/react` (`Handle`, `Position`, `NodeProps`), `./styling` (`systemStatusColor`, `systemClassColor`), `./InlineTextEdit`, `./MapPresenceContext` (`usePresenceForSystem`), `./MapUnderglowContext` (`useUnderglowForSystem`), `./SystemUnderglow`, `@base-ui/react/preview-card` (hover-card primitive), `lucide-react` (`Lock`, `Users`).
