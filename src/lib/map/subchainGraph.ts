/**
 * Pure graph traversal for the "delete subchain" feature. No `server-only`
 * import — the same code runs on the client (to preview/highlight the doomed
 * set) and on the server (to recompute it authoritatively before deleting).
 *
 * A subchain is defined by a `head` (the system being deleted, plus its branch)
 * and an `anchor` (the keep-side root — the map's Home when one is set, else a
 * neighbour the user picks). The subchain is the head plus every system that
 * becomes unreachable from the anchor once the head is removed — i.e. the head
 * and everything hanging off it *away* from the anchor. The anchor side, the
 * head's parent (which sits between head and anchor), and any system still
 * reachable from the anchor via another route (a loop back to known space) are
 * all preserved.
