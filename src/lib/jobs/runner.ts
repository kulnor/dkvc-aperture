 *
 * Boot order:
 *   1. `startWorker()` calls graphile-worker's own `runMigrations` to create /
 *      upgrade the `graphile_worker` schema.
 *   2. Then `run({ pgPool, taskList, parsedCronItems, ... })` returns the
 *      long-lived `Runner` which holds the worker pool + cron + LISTEN side.
 *
 * `noHandleSignals: true` is set because `server.ts` owns process-level
 * SIGTERM/SIGINT and explicitly calls `stopWorker` so we don't race with
 * graphile-worker's own signal handlers (which would also shut down our HTTP
 * server-attached resources independently).

/**
 * Re-arm the location-poll loop on boot, before the pool starts. Two failure

 *
 *   1. **Orphaned lock** — after an unclean shutdown (crash / SIGKILL / power
 *      loss, or in dev `tsx watch` hard-killing the child on Windows) the row
 *      stays `locked_at IS NOT NULL`. graphile-worker only reclaims it after a
 *      hardcoded 4h (`resetLockedAt`, not configurable in 0.16); until then even
 *      an immediate restart won't touch the locked row.
 *   2. **Exhausted retries** — a job that burned all `max_attempts` is unlocked
 *      and permanently failed. graphile never runs it again, and nothing
 *      re-enqueues (the per-map seed marker already exists), so the loop is dead
 *      for good. The client's 401 handling makes this far less likely, but any
 *      other persistent error could still walk a loop to exhaustion.
 *
 * Both are revived here: clear the lock, reset the attempt budget, and pull
 * `run_at` to now. Scoped to `location-poll` only — it's idempotent (the jump
 * fold dedupes; the re-enqueue uses `jobKey: 'replace'`), so the worst case
 * under an overlapping deploy is one character double-polling for a single tick.
 * We deliberately do NOT blanket-reset every task: a long, non-idempotent job
 * (e.g. `sdeIngest`) legitimately held by a still-draining instance must not be
 * yanked out from under it, which is why a worker-scoped `force_unlock_workers`
 * is wrong here. The lock columns mirror graphile-worker's own `resetLockedAt`.
