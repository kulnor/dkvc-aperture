## systemEffects.ts

**Purpose:** Typed, resolved W-space system-effect reference data for the System Effects dialog.
**File:** `src/lib/eve/systemEffects.ts`

---

### SYSTEM_EFFECTS: SystemEffect[]
The six W-space anomaly effects (Magnetar, Red Giant, Pulsar, Wolf-Rayet Star, Cataclysmic Variable, Black Hole), each with its per-class bonus list already resolved to final values (no multiplier logic for consumers). Built at module load from the per-strength tables + class→strength resolution.

Each `SystemEffect` is `{ key, name, classes: { classId, bonuses: { effect, value }[] }[] }`. `classes` holds one entry per class the effect occurs in (C1–C6 plus the relevant Drifter/shattered class), ascending by id.

### systemEffectName(key: SystemEffectKey): string
Display name for an effect key — e.g. `wolfRayet` → `"Wolf-Rayet Star"`. Falls back to the raw key if unknown.

### systemEffectBonuses(key: SystemEffectKey, classId: number): SystemEffectBonus[]
The effect's bonuses resolved to a specific system class. Resolves the class→strength tier directly off the per-strength table, so it covers every class an effect can occur in (including shattered/Drifter holes not enumerated in `SYSTEM_EFFECTS[].classes`). Returns `[]` for an unknown key or a class with no tier (e.g. Thera, `C12`). Used by `SystemNode`'s effect indicator.

### EFFECT_CLASS_LABELS: Record<number, string>
Display labels for the class ids an effect can carry — `1→'C1'` … `6→'C6'`, plus shattered/Drifter (`13→'C13 (Shattered)'`, `14→'C14 (Sentinel)'`, `15→'C15 (Barbican)'`, `16→'C16 (Vidette)'`, `17→'C17 (Conflux)'`, `18→'C18 (Redoubt)'`).

### Types
- `SystemEffectBonus` — `{ effect: string; value: string }`.
- `SystemEffectKey` — union of the six effect keys.
- `SystemEffect` — see above. Re-exported (with `SystemEffectBonus`) from `src/types/index.ts`.

### Notes
Class→strength resolution: C1–C6 use their own number; shattered frigate holes (13) read as C6 strength; Drifter space (14–18) reads as C2 strength.
