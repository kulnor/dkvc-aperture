/**
 * Pure jump classifier consumed by the location-poll. Decides
 * whether a transition between two systems is a gate jump (ignore — gates are
 * already on every map by virtue of `universe_stargate_edge`) or a wormhole
 * jump (fold onto the character's tracked maps as `system.added` /
 * `connection.create` events).
 *
 * Single PK probe against `universe_stargate_edge` in either direction; no
 * recursion, no path-finding. The edge table is bidirectional in practice
 * (each stargate pair lives as two rows) but we check both orderings
 * defensively in case a future SDE ingest stops mirroring them.
 *
 * Classifications outside `gate`/`wormhole` (e.g. cyno, jump bridge, abyssal
 * trace) are NOT modelled here — the rebuild treats every non-gate transition
 * as a wormhole. Those rarer cases land alongside the broader intel module
 * work in later stages.
