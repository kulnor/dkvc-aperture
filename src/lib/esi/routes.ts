/**
 * OpenAPI-backed route resolver for the ESI client.
 *
 * `opkeys.ts` maps an opKey to an OpenAPI `operationId`; this module resolves
 * that `operationId` to the concrete HTTP method, version-prefixed path
 * template (e.g. `/v1/characters/{character_id}/location/`), and the names of
 * its path/query parameters. `src/lib/esi/openapi.json` is the single source of
 * truth — the resolver reads it rather than duplicating method/path data, so
 * ESI route drift surfaces here rather than as a hand-maintained typo.
 *
 * The OpenAPI file is a static import (not an `fs` read) so it is bundled with
 * the code: it ships in every runtime — the Next-compiled server chunks AND the
 * tsx-run job process — with no dependency on the working directory or on a
 * docs/ asset being copied into the image. Server-only; never bundled to the
 * browser (ESI calls run in jobs / server actions / route handlers).
