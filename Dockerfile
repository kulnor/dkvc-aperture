# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Aperture runs through a custom Node entrypoint (server.ts via tsx) so the
# WebSocket upgrade handler and graphile-worker share one process with the
# Next.js app (SPEC §5.5). Consequences for this image:
#   - The runtime keeps the FULL dependency tree: `pnpm start` is `tsx server.ts`
#     and tsx is a devDependency. No `--prod` prune.
#   - The runtime keeps the TS source: server.ts dynamically imports
#     @/lib/realtime/wsServer and @/lib/jobs/runner, which tsx compiles on the
#     fly. So there is no `next start` / `output: standalone` path.

# are NEXT_PUBLIC_*). The encryption key is validated lazily, not at import, so
