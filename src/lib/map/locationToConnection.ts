/**
 * Pure jump classifier consumed by the location-poll. Decides
 * whether a transition between two systems is a gate jump (ignore — gates are
 * already on every map by virtue of `universe_stargate_edge`) or a wormhole
 * jump (fold onto the character's tracked maps as `system.added` /
 * `connection.create` events).
 *
 * Single PK probe against `universe_stargate_edge` in either direction; no
 * recursion, no path-finding. The edge table is bidirectional in practice
 * (each stargate pair lives as two rows) but we check both orderings
 * defensively in case a future SDE ingest stops mirroring them.
 *
 * Classifications outside `gate`/`wormhole`/`teleport`/`abyssal` (e.g. cyno,
 * jump bridge) are NOT modelled here — the rebuild treats every other non-gate,
 * in-space transition as a wormhole. Those rarer cases land alongside the
 * broader intel module work in later stages.
 *
 * `teleport` covers pod self-destruct ("pod express"), getting podded by
 * hostiles, and jump clones: instant moves to a medical/jump clone that the
 * poll would otherwise misread as a wormhole. The tell is that the pilot
 * arrives **docked** — you can never exit a wormhole already docked, so a
 * docked arrival in a non-gate-adjacent system is a teleport-to-station, not a
 * traversal. Gated to k-space destinations because clones can only live there.
 *
 * `abyssal` covers any transition where either endpoint is an abyssal system
 * (`universe_system.security = 'A'`). Abyssals are reached only through
 * single-use filaments, so the link can never be re-traversed by anyone else —
 * it isn't a real chain edge. We never map abyssal systems or their links.
